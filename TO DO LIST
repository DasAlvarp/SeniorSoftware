To do:

1. Each team have dynamic scores (based on categories) and scores linked only to them

2. Calculate overall score as a culmunation of the subscores and displaying all seperately

3. Way to combine all of the judges scores into one

4. Verify that all judges scores given are independent of each other


******should judges scores be an attribute of the judge or team??? -i think judge but corresponds to team however I'm not sure
